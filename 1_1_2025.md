# The Last Text File I Write in VS Cod(e|ium)

VS Code is becoming too entrenched in Microsoft’s broader business strategy. At this point, that influence is no longer subtle, and it has finally pushed me to give up on full-featured IDEs altogether.

I’m moving to Vim.

I've come to realize that all i want is a fast, predictable tool for editing text, that i can personally completely. Instead, I've been slowly watching my editor drift away from helping me to helping boost a public companies stock price.

## My Personal History with Text Editors

### High School (2009–2011)

In high school, I used DrJava, Eclipse, and Matlab(I actually loved how interactive matlab's notbooks were) while learning the fundamentals of computer science. These were tools assigned to me, and I didn’t think much about editors at the time. I had a really cool gateway laptop (probably something like the Gateway MD7309u 15.6” Notebook 2009 Intel Pentium) and this timeperiod was where i fell in love with making programs and games.

### College (2011–2014): Sublime Text

Sublime Text was my first real editor. It was also my first exposure to extending an editor, and it’s where I fell in love with multi-cursor editing. During this time I learned regex and was writing mostly Python, but I gradually moved toward JavaScript as I learned more about web technologies through internships.

Eventually, I hit the ceiling of Sublime’s plugin ecosystem. The API at the time made deeper extensions difficult, and I found myself wanting to build things that simply weren’t possible.

### GitHub Atom

I switched to Atom within a week of its announcement. The ability to write extensions in JavaScript, or CoffeeScript, gave me nearly unlimited flexibility, and it felt like the first editor that genuinely wanted to be hacked on. The ability to personalize Atom completely changed I thought about IDEs.

### Facebook (2015–2018): Atom

At Facebook, I used Atom full-time and loved it. I never personally experienced performance issues, and the ecosystem was strong. Facebook also had an internal team (Nuclide), maintaining deep editor integrations.

### Facebook (2019): VSCode

Eventually, that team shifted its focus to VS Code. Atom support stagnated, and I was effectively forced to migrate. VS Code replicated most of what I wanted, but I never actually wanted to switch.

### Carta (2020–2021): VSCode

At Carta, I continued using VS Code, although this period wasn’t really about tooling. I was burned out, COVID and full-time work from home were draining, and I lost momentum in web development. I started questioning my career direction altogether, and during this time the editor simply didn’t matter much.

### Google (2021–2024): VSCode

After switching to the Chrome team, VS Code became the path of least resistance. It had strong built-in integrations, easy development server workflows, and reasonable defaults. That situation held until 2024.

### 2024: The Turn

In 2024, VS Code started actively working against my preferences. Copilot and increasingly aggressive AI autocomplete were introduced, even though I never used Copilot myself. Autocompletion was constantly pushed, and while it was mostly disableable, I only tolerated it rather than welcomed it.

Around the same time, I started building my own AI-assisted coding tools. Agentic tooling was easy to build even before it became mainstream, and Chrome’s use cases didn’t align with existing tools like Aider. I didn’t use anything from Anthropic and ended up building my own solutions instead.

I built a Chromium debug helper that I shared internally. It was a standalone Electron application, not integrated into VS Code. I did attempt to integrate it through a chat panel, but VS Code makes custom panels unnecessarily painful, and I eventually gave up because it wasn’t worth the effort.

### Late 2024 – Early 2025: VSCode Chat Everywhere

This period marked the breaking point. VS Code introduced a first-party chat panel that was clearly meant to compete with Cursor. It overrode my keybindings and could not be fully disabled. Every update since its introduction has caused regressions, and this behavior exists even in VS Codium, which is baffling.

At this point, AI/Chat/Github stopped being “a feature” and started becoming the main feature.

The final straw came with changes to the Quick Fix action. Something I use often to fix includes now attempts to invoke an AI tool, even when no fix is applicable, and even when the issue is just an LSP problem or an ignored clang error. Microsoft is effectively suggesting that I ask an AI, which is confusing and unnecessary.

_Maybe I can disable this. I probably can. But I'm tired._

Every release adds another thing I need to hunt down, override, or undo in the best case, in some cases you cant even disable it at all. For my use case, opening files, searching files, editing text, and having a terminal on the left, the editor is objectively getting worse.

As a side note, the VS Code extension ecosystem feels like it’s waning. I’ve written extensions and helped other maintainers, and I no longer have interest in contributing free labor to a platform that increasingly works against me.

## So What’s Next?

I’m switching to Vim, fully.

I already use it for smaller tasks, and it’s portable, predictable, and text-first. It’s built for composition rather than accretion. There are solid plugins for multi-cursor editing, LSP support, and everything I actually need. My teammate Atharv recently gave a talk about learning Vim. His ramp-up took a couple of months, which feels realistic and acceptable.

At this point, I’d rather invest time learning a tool that resists bloat than keep fighting one that embraces it. (And just to be clear Github is probably next...) I will be going through and making some fun learning tools for vim to help teach myself, and hopefully provide something back to the community of people who are tired of bloated IDEs that are intentionally trying to shift our industry towards pumping microsoft stock prices and spending API dollars with microsoft products.

Anyways This is the last file I write in VS Code, bye bye.
